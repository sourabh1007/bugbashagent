## Your Analysis Task

Provide a comprehensive scenario-based analysis covering:

### 1. **Product Quality Assessment Based on Scenarios**
- Evaluate overall product quality based on scenario success rate ({{scenario_success_rate}}%)
- Assess which business scenarios are working correctly vs. failing
- Determine product readiness based on critical scenario coverage
- Comment on the reliability of core functionality

### 2. **Scenario Success Analysis**
- Identify which scenarios passed and what this indicates about product stability
- Analyze the business value of successfully implemented scenarios
- Assess coverage of user workflows and use cases
- Evaluate if critical paths are properly validated

### 3. **ðŸš¨ FAILED SCENARIOS - DETAILED ANALYSIS**

For each failed scenario, provide:

**Scenario Impact Assessment**:
- Business criticality of the failed scenario
- User experience impact if this functionality fails
- Risk level for production deployment

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Why this scenario likely failed (analyze the technical reasons)
- Whether it's a design flaw, implementation issue, or environmental problem
- Pattern analysis across failed scenarios

**Specific Resolutions**:
- Step-by-step technical resolution for each failed scenario
- Code changes required (be specific to {{language}} and {{product_name}})
- Configuration or setup adjustments needed
- Testing approach to validate the fix

**Prevention Strategies**:
- How to prevent similar scenario failures in future iterations
- Additional validation that should be added
- Best practices specific to this type of scenario

### 4. **Product Quality Metrics**
- Overall product stability based on scenario outcomes
- Critical vs. non-critical scenario success rates
- User journey completion rates
- Performance implications from scenario testing

### 5. **Actionable Recommendations**

**Immediate Priority Actions** (if scenarios failed):
- Which failed scenarios to fix first (prioritized by business impact)
- Specific {{language}} code patterns that need correction
- Infrastructure or dependency issues to resolve

**Product Enhancement**:
- Additional scenarios that should be tested
- Edge cases not currently covered
- {{language}}-specific improvements for better reliability

**Quality Assurance Strategy**:
- Long-term testing strategy for {{product_name}}
- Scenario-based testing best practices
- Continuous validation approaches

### 6. **Production Readiness Assessment**
- Go/No-go recommendation based on scenario analysis
- Risk assessment for deployment
- Monitoring and observability recommendations
- Rollback strategy if issues arise

## Format Your Response

Structure your analysis with clear headings, bullet points, and specific technical details. Focus on business scenarios rather than individual test cases. For failed scenarios, be very detailed in the analysis and resolution sections.

**Critical Focus**: Prioritize scenario impact over test case mechanics. Provide actionable, technical solutions specific to {{language}} and {{product_name}}.
