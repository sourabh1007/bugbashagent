```

## Your Analysis Task

Provide a comprehensive analysis covering:

### 1. **Overall Assessment**
- Evaluate the overall quality of the test results
- Assess whether the success rate is acceptable for a generated project
- Comment on the test execution performance

### 2. **Failure Analysis** (if applicable)
- Analyze the root causes of test failures
- Identify patterns in the failures
- Determine if failures are due to:
  - Code generation issues
  - Test setup problems
  - Environment/dependency issues
  - Actual logic errors

### 3. **Test Quality Insights**
- Evaluate test coverage relative to the number of scenarios
- Assess if the test frameworks are appropriate for {{language}}
- Comment on test execution time and performance

### 4. **Specific Recommendations**

Provide actionable recommendations for:

**Immediate Fixes** (if tests failed):
- Specific steps to resolve failing tests
- Code changes that might be needed
- Configuration or setup adjustments

**Test Improvement**:
- Ways to improve test coverage
- Additional test scenarios to consider
- Best practices for {{language}} testing

**Code Quality**:
- Suggestions for improving the generated code
- Patterns to avoid in future generations
- {{language}}-specific best practices

### 5. **Next Steps**
- Priority order for addressing issues
- Whether the code is ready for production use
- Additional testing that might be needed

## Format Your Response

Structure your analysis with clear headings and bullet points. Be specific about {{language}} and {{product_name}} context. If all tests passed, focus on code quality validation and potential improvements.

**Important**: Base your analysis on the actual test results provided. Be constructive and actionable in your recommendations.
