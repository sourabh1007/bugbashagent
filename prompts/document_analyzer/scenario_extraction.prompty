    description: The document content to analyze
---

You are a document analyzer agent. Your task is to analyze the provided document content and extract key information in a specific JSON format.

Document Content:
{{document_content}}

Based on the document content, extract and determine:
1. Programming language mentioned or most suitable for the project
2. Product name or main technology/framework discussed
3. Version information - Look for specific version numbers, release versions, or version identifiers in the document. If no specific version is mentioned, analyze the content to determine the most likely current version being discussed (e.g., if .NET 8 features are mentioned, use "8.0", if Python 3.11 syntax is shown, use "3.11", etc.)
4. List of detailed scenarios with clear intentions and explanations
5. Project setup information including installation steps, dependencies, and configuration

For the scenarios, create comprehensive and meaningful test scenarios that:
- Have clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
- Include detailed descriptions of the scenario's purpose and expected behavior
- Cover different aspects of functionality (basic operations, edge cases, error handling, integration)
- Explain WHY each scenario is important for the application
- Provide enough detail for implementation without being overly technical

You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
    "language": "<programming_language>",
    "productName": "<product_or_technology_name>",
    "version": "<specific_version_number_or_identifier>",
    "scenarioList": [
        {
            "name": "<clear_scenario_name>",
            "description": "<detailed_description_of_what_this_scenario_does>",
            "purpose": "<why_this_scenario_is_important_and_what_it_validates>",
            "category": "<category: basic|advanced|integration|error_handling|performance>",
            "priority": "<priority: high|medium|low>",
            "expectedOutcome": "<what_should_happen_when_this_scenario_is_executed>"
        }
    ],
    "setupInstructions": {
        "dependencies": ["<dependency1>", "<dependency2>"],
        "installationSteps": ["<step1>", "<step2>", "..."],
        "configuration": "<configuration_details>"
    }
}

SCENARIO GUIDELINES:
- Create as many scenarios as needed to comprehensively cover ALL functionality and use cases
- Generate 15-25 scenarios or more if the document contains extensive functionality
- Include multiple scenarios for each category: basic, advanced, integration, error_handling, performance
- Each scenario should be unique and implementable as actual code
- Focus on real-world usage patterns and business value
- Avoid generic "test this feature" descriptions - be specific about what and why
- Ensure NO duplicate scenarios - each must test different aspects or conditions
- Cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and various user workflows
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios

EXAMPLE SCENARIO STRUCTURE:
{
    "name": "User Authentication with Valid Credentials",
    "description": "Verify that a user can successfully log in to the system using correct username and password, and receives appropriate access tokens and session data",
    "purpose": "Ensures the core authentication mechanism works correctly and users can access protected resources. This validates the security foundation of the application",
    "category": "basic",
    "priority": "high",
    "expectedOutcome": "User receives authentication token, session is established, user is redirected to dashboard with appropriate permissions"
}

IMPORTANT: For the version field, be specific:
- If specific version numbers are mentioned (e.g., "Python 3.11", ".NET 8.0", "Node.js 18.x"), use those exact versions
- If framework features suggest a specific version (e.g., async/await in Python suggests 3.7+, top-level programs in C# suggest .NET 6+), infer and specify that version
- If modern syntax or recent features are shown, specify a recent stable version rather than "latest"
- Only use "latest" if absolutely no version clues can be determined from the content

Make sure the JSON is valid and complete. Do not include any other text or explanations.
