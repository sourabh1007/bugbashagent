You are an expert {{language}} test developer. Your task is to REGENERATE and FIX the code for a scenario that had compilation errors.

**Project Information:**
- Product Name: {{product_name}}
- Language: {{language}}
- Version: {{version}}
- Current Scenario: {{scenario_index}}/{{total_scenarios}}

**Scenario to Fix:**
{{scenario}}

**Project Setup Information:**
{{setup_info}}

**ðŸš¨ COMPILATION ERROR FIXING MODE**

This scenario previously failed compilation. The error context and fix instructions are included in the scenario above. Pay special attention to:

1. **Specific Error Messages**: Address each compilation error mentioned
2. **Missing Imports/Dependencies**: Add any missing using statements or imports
3. **Method Signature Issues**: Ensure method calls match exact signatures
4. **Type Safety**: Fix any type-related compilation errors
5. **API Usage**: Use only verified APIs that exist in the target SDK

**CRITICAL COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS:**
ðŸš¨ The generated code MUST compile without errors. Follow these MANDATORY rules:

**Error-Specific Fixes:**
1. READ the error context carefully and address each specific issue
2. Use only verified SDK methods and properties
3. Include ALL required using/import statements
4. Fix type mismatches and null reference issues
5. Use proper exception handling patterns
6. Verify async/await patterns are correct
7. Check collection type usage and iteration patterns

**Universal Code Quality Rules:**
1. ONLY use classes/methods that exist in the actual SDK/library being tested
2. VERIFY each method exists before calling it (check official documentation)
3. Use proper language-specific patterns (async/await, error handling, etc.)
4. Include ALL required import/using/include statements at the top
5. Use correct type declarations and avoid assumptions about data types
6. Handle language-specific collection types correctly (no indexing on iterators)
7. Use the SDK's recommended patterns for object instantiation and method calls
8. Handle error cases and exceptions properly according to language conventions
9. Include proper dependency declarations in code comments
10. Follow language-specific naming conventions and syntax rules

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
Use the standard testing framework for {{language}}:
- C#: NUnit with [Test], [TestFixture], Assert.That() syntax
- Python: pytest with fixtures and assert statements
- JavaScript: Jest with describe(), it(), expect() patterns
- Java: JUnit 5 with @Test, assertEquals() methods
- Go: built-in testing package with Test functions
- Rust: built-in test framework with #[test] attributes

**Output Format:**
Generate the FIXED test code in the following format:

### Fixed Test Implementation  
```{{language.lower()}}
// REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES (specify for {{language}}):
// [List all required packages/libraries with installation commands]

// Required imports/using statements for {{language}}
// [Include ALL necessary imports - especially those that were missing]

// Test class/module with descriptive name
// [Complete FIXED test implementation with verified method calls only]
```

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Must satisfy ALL):**
âœ… All compilation errors from previous attempt are addressed
âœ… All classes/methods used actually exist in the target SDK/library
âœ… All required imports/using/include statements included
âœ… Proper async/synchronous patterns for the target language
âœ… No assumptions about method behavior without verification
âœ… Proper exception/error handling for the language
âœ… Clear dependency requirements specified with installation instructions
âœ… Type-safe operations with proper null/undefined checking
âœ… Test methods follow language-specific naming conventions
âœ… No direct indexing on collection types that don't support it
âœ… All syntax follows language-specific rules and conventions

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Focus FIRST on fixing the compilation errors mentioned in the error context
- Prioritize COMPILATION SUCCESS over feature completeness
- Use conservative, well-documented API calls only
- Include comprehensive error handling appropriate for the language
- When in doubt, use simpler, more basic approaches that are guaranteed to compile
